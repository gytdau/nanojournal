# nanojournal
Microjournalling platform. Like Twitter, but personal and built to increase your productivity.

Nanojournal is based on the concept of interstitial journalling: Whenever you are about to switch tasks, take a moment and jot it down on Nanojournal. This helps you keep focused and maintain flow, even if things are getting difficult or uncomfortable and you'd rather be spending time on the Internet.
